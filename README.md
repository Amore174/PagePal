# PagePal

## Introduction
PagePal is an Android mobile application designed to enhance reading and comprehension across various formats, whether you're dealing with physical books, research reports, textbooks, or digital content. Built with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, this app leverages Google's Gemini genAI model to provide instant definitions, summaries, and intelligent image interpretations directly from your mobile device.

## Features
